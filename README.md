# LLM-Bidding-Markets-Sequential-Auctions-for-Query-Routing-and-Price-Optimization
Models query routing as a sequential auction among LLMs. User selects the model maximizing quasilinear utility (value - cost). The platform optimizes utility &amp; profit under strategic bidding and stochastic/unknown value using mechanism design and online learning. This project models query routing as a sequential auction among LLMs.
